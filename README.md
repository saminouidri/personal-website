## What is this project about?

The idea was to create a personal website that could act as both a blog, personal web-front and portfolio for my projects.

To add a fun twist, I decided to design two UIs for the landing page, with one being "retro" styled and the other more "modern". In addition to information about myself, I intend to write a few articles on some of my thoughts on current technological trends and happenings. As such, users browsing can also read these articles on the website.
